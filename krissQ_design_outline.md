\# kirssQ is a python package for qubit measurement and related useful libraries.  
\# Below I outline things that I'd like to include in the package

# General rules for design 
- Design for interface.
- How to configure experiments
- Make it modular
- Make it easy for scripting
- Make it easy to extend
- Obey SOLID principle as much as possible
    - Single responsibility principle
    - Open-closed principle: open for  extension, close for modification
    - Liskov substitution principle
    - Interface segregation principle
    - Dependency inversion principle
 - Obey PEP8

# krissqgl: kriss Quantum Gate Language package
- Act as an interface layer between gate layer and physical hardware's API to define pulse sequences
     (no need to know each AWG's language/API)
- Use gates in most cases (without knowing how to create them in reality) in defining pulse seqs.
- Would this be practical for ZI and QM?

## Modules:
- Channels: qubit(), readout(), logical channel, physical channel, channelmapper
- Pulseprimatives (Utheta, Xtheta, Ytheta, CR, echoCR, rotaryCR, ...)
- Pulsequencer : define pulse sequences
- Pulseshapes: define shapes of pulses
- Pulsecollection (collections of functions or classes) 
    - characterization: spec, Rabi, Ramsey, Echo, T1, decoupling..
    - calibration: RabiampCal, PiCal, Pi2Cal, DragCal, CR ... 
    - verification: RB, QST, QPT, HamiltonianTomo, GST,...
    - PulseSeqPlotter
    
## Directory:
- drivers: ZI, QM, ...

# krissqm: kriss quantum measurement package 
    
## package/module/class
- experiment (FileHandler, Sweeper, ...)
- instruments
    - various instrument drivers here
    - AgilentE8257D
    - SIM928
- analysis
     - fitting (T1, Ramsey,...)
     - characterization
- utility (load_data, plotting, ...)
- plotter
- pulse
- calibration

# krissanalysis: kriss analysis library
- Fittings
    - T1, Ramsey, DragFit, CRFit, ...
    - Resonator fit, ...
